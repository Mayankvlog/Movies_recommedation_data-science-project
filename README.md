# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System - MLOps Project

A production-ready movie recommendation system powered by deep learning and deployed with complete MLOps practices.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements an intelligent movie recommendation engine using a 5-layer neural network autoencoder. The system analyzes movie genres through TF-IDF vectorization and generates personalized recommendations using cosine similarity on learned embeddings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn  
**MLOps:** MLflow, pytest, CircleCI  
**Deployment:** Streamlit  
**Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
